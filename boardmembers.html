                    <li><strong>Bio:</strong> Chris has been an avid origami folder since age 12, when he realized that homework can be 
                        repurposed (rightfully so) into paper airplanes. A San Diego native, he is a good friend of good 
                        weather, and really appreciates Mexican food. When Chris isn’t folding origami, you can find him 
                        skating, running, hiking, playing board games, trying to figure out how to use Zoom, or hanging out 
                        with members of the Asian American Christian Fellowship at UCLA. </li>

                    <li><strong>Major:</strong> Biology</li>
                    <li><strong>Bio:</strong> Benny has always done origami ever since he first got introduced to it by his close cousin 
                        when he was little. He has on and off done it since all throughout middle school and high school, 
                        especially during class when bored. Outside origami and academics, Benny especially enjoys staying 
                        active, such as playing sports like soccer or tennis. He deeply enjoys hiking and is now an avid 
                        rock climber. In his free time, you can also catch him at the piano attempting to practice 40 hours 
                        a day, skating, or spiking people in smash.  </li>

                    <li><strong>Year:</strong> Second</li>
                    <li><strong>Member Since:</strong> 2019</li>
                    <li><strong>Major:</strong>: English and Philosophy</li>
                    <li><strong>Bio:</strong> Normal children stay up deep into the night, playing games or watching videos on the Internet, 
                        but when he himself was a child, Ezra spent his nights… playing games and watching videos on the 
                        Internet. Though sometimes, in high school, he would stay up whittling away at some origami project or 
                        other. Now, he stays up late into the night playing video games or procrastinating on yet another paper. 
                        Origami is for the day time… during class. Else, one might find him playing video games or working on 
                        some other art project or doing philosophy with an unfortunate friend or attempting and failing to come 
                        up with the next C.S. Lewis masterpiece.</li>

                    <li><strong>Bio:</strong> Jasper has always liked using origami to add a more personal touch when gift-giving. He enjoys 
                        running, cooking, playing badminton, taking photos, listening to music, and flying RC helicopters. 
                        You can also find him lurking on Summoner’s Rift. </li>

                    <li><strong>Member Since:</strong> 2020</li>
                    <li><strong>Major:</strong> Cognitive Science</li>
                    <li><strong>Bio:</strong> Kelly first started folding origami in elementary school, and had an especially huge origami 
                        phase in middle school. Although she does not fold origami as much anymore, she has a huge 
                        appreciation for the craft and loves to see other peoples’ creations. In her free time, Kelly loves 
                        to do anything art-related (especially bullet journaling, painting, and calligraphy) and hanging out 
                        with friends and family. </li>

                    <li><strong>Major:</strong> Psychology</li>
                    <li><strong>Bio:</strong> When her grandma first taught her how to fold an origami crane, Stephanie fell in love with the art. 
                        As she continued to expand her origami repertoire, she realized that giving it as a gift was much 
                        better than keeping it for herself. Today, Steph continues to fold origami gifts for friends, family, 
                        and peers. In her free time, she enjoys folding origami (OBVIOUSLY), chewing a TON of gum, hanging with 
                        friends (now with 100% more Zoom), going roofing, and binging Youtube for 5 hours.</li>
