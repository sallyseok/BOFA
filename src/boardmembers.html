                    <li><strong>Major:</strong> Mechanical Engineering</li>
                    <li><strong>Bio:</strong> Origami is a passion that has been a part of Mark ever since he can remember. 
                        Like really, I actually don’t remember what age I was lol. From the moment he first learned the art 
                        from his uncle, to a short-lived origami business in 6th grade, to an ever-increasing collection of 
                        models, Mark has lived and breathed origami. While he’s not very good at writing bios, he is kinda 
                        funny so I guess that makes up for it. His passions in video editing and photoshopping are frequently 
                        put to use in the creation of epic memes to make his friends laugh. Other things he enjoys include 
                        Birding, personal protective equipment (PPE), and De Neve Commons Residential Restaurant.</li>

                    <li><strong>Bio:</strong> Chris has been an avid origami folder since age 12, when he realized that 
                        homework can be repurposed (rightfully so) into paper airplanes. A San Diego native, he is a good 
                        friend of good weather, and really appreciates Mexican food. When Chris isn’t folding origami, 
                        you can find him skating, running, hiking, playing board games, trying to figure out how to use 
                        Zoom, or hanging out with members of the Asian American Christian Fellowship at UCLA. </li>

                    <li><strong>Bio:</strong> Benny has always done origami ever since he first got introduced to it 
                        by his close cousin when he was little. He has on and off done it since all throughout middle 
                        school and high school, especially during class when bored. Outside origami and academics, 
                        Benny especially enjoys staying active, such as playing sports like soccer or tennis. He 
                        deeply enjoys hiking and is now an avid rock climber. In his free time, you can also catch him 
                        at the piano attempting to practice 40 hours a day, skating, or spiking people in smash.  </li>

                    <li><strong>Bio:</strong> Crane. Box. Ninja star. Fox. Long ago, Nick was a bright-eyed boy who 
                        loved folding origami. Then, everything changed when video games attacked. Only productivity, 
                        master of all disciplines, could stop them. But when Nick needed it most, it vanished. 19 years 
                        passed and UCLA introduced a new source of origami inspiration, a folding club called BOFA, and 
                        although its lessons are great, it has a lot to grow before it can inspire anyone. But I believe 
                        BOFA can inspire the world. Nick is also a massive dweeb and weeb.</li>

                    <li><strong>Bio:</strong> Nyla has enjoyed folding origami since she was in elementary school, mainly to make homework more...enticing.

                        videos on the Internet. Though sometimes, in high school, he would stay up whittling away at some 
                        origami project or other. Now, he stays up late into the night playing video games or procrastinating 
                        on yet another paper. Origami is for the day time… during class. Else, one might find him playing 
                        video games or working on some other art project or doing philosophy with an unfortunate friend 
                        or attempting and failing to come up with the next C.S. Lewis masterpiece.</li>

                        wants to learn. She has always loved the geometric nature of folding paper and can often be found
                        folding it under the table in class. Karen also enjoys avoiding schoolwork by playing the violin in 
                        musicals and orchestras and spending time on the archery range.</li>

                        dropping cranes left and right. His favorite is the Pegasus though. Now he begins his exploration of 
                        tessellation. More on this in the future. Aside from origami you can find him practicing his sleight of 
                        hand and his smash bro’s techniques. When he’s not bunkered down you can find him at the golf range or at 
                        the snow slopes eating it badly.</li>

                        going out for boba runs, hiking, running, and hanging out with friends. Andy is also open to trying out

                        it as a gift was much better than keeping it for herself. Today, Steph continues to fold origami gifts 
                        for friends, family, and peers. In her free time, she enjoys folding origami (OBVIOUSLY), chewing a TON 
                        of gum, hanging with friends (now with 100% more Zoom), going roofing, and binging Youtube for 5 hours.
